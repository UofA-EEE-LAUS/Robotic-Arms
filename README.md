Inverse_Kinematics.m - Robotic Arm model dimension & parameter defination (essentially creates an object that is our robot arm)


Arm_simulation.m - Ploting Robotic Arm model in a vitrual 3D dimension (the code that you run to do the simulation)

## SETUP

You will first need to download 2 toolboxes for MATLAB for the simulation to work. They can be found here: \
http://petercorke.com/wordpress/toolboxes/robotics-toolbox \
http://petercorke.com/wordpress/toolboxes/machine-vision-toolbox

On both pages, scroll down until you find the "Install from .mltbx file" section and then download the latest version. Click the promtps until it is installed.

Peter Corke is the author of both toolboxes and has also written a great textbook on robotics called *Robotics Vision and Control*, this can be found here:

It is a good starting point for learning how to model and simulate many different types of robots in MATLAB. This textbook also explains his toolboxes and how to use them.
